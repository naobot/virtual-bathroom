      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          Free our pee! If you are a business, building or public space that offers access to its washrooms to <strong>everyone</strong>—not just paying customers—you can use this sticker to let people know your facilities are safe and welcoming to all. 
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>By refusing to build safe, accessible, and hygienic public washrooms, cities endanger the health and safety of large portions of the population:</strong> the unhoused, people with illnesses like chronic pain or inflammatory bowel diseases, people with limited ranges of mobility, the pregnant, the elderly, parents and caretakers of young children, gig workers with no fixed workplace, workers with long commutes, and many others. Inequities in washroom design and availability fall along gender, race, and class lines. Our public lives are limited by knowing when and where we might be able to use a washroom should we need one. When we’re denied toilets, soap and clean water, we are being denied the irreducible minimum required to fulfil our most basic bodily functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following trends in austerity, gentrification, and privatization, cities have offloaded the need for public washrooms onto commercial spaces. Coffee shops and restaurants have become our defacto meeting places. Malls, food halls, and coworking spaces market and style themselves as community hubs. However, many businesses regularly make their washrooms available to paying customers only. The embarrassment and stigma around having to line up and ask for a washroom code or key without paying for anything is a social deterrent. The Covid-19 pandemic has further reduced access to public toilets, even though the risk of transmission from bathrooms—with proper mask wearing and other hygiene measures—<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-risky-is-using-a-public-bathroom-during-the-pandemic-2020071420556&sa=D&ust=1600134235315000&usg=AFQjCNHQQbE2kJ69O8UyA115H3xabkH9wQ" target="_blank">is comparatively lower risk than other indoor activities</a>. 
        </p>
        <h4>Our municipal governments need to make truly public bathrooms a priority. In the meantime, let’s make sure that everyone has a place to go!</h4>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/totoiletcodes?lang=en" target="_blank">TO Toilet Codes</a> is a Twitter account inspired by and created in solidarity with the <a href="https://twitter.com/ldnloocodes" target="_blank">London Loo Codes</a> project. We post the locations and accessibility information of various Toronto private and public washrooms, including the access codes some businesses use to deter non-paying customers from using their facilities. Our information is submitted to us by washroom-goers throughout the city, and anyone can drop us a line!
